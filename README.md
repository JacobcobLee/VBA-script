# VBA-script
i created this project as part of an internship and what it designed to do is to take xl column from xl file and deposit them into xs column in xs file

in the middle of copying data over, it will also transform/manipulate the data into different information

# Use case
copy the adress from file A and just capture the postal code and paste it into file B. sounds easy but have to filter and know what is a postal code. then extract it from any place in the address.
E.g 123 abc sun shining place 694200 

Extracted information: 694200

like wise for countries and marketing data.
